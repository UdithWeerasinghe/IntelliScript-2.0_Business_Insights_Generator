4. Temporal Trends & Insights 
• Seasonality & Peaks: 
o Sales tend to spike around the end of January and mid-March, perhaps 
reflecting post-holiday promotions and pre-Easter demand. 
o Camera and screen-protector profits exhibit the highest volatility, suggesting 
promotional campaigns or inventory cycles. 
• Category Correlations: 
o Smartphones and back-covers move together—when phone profits rise, 
accessory sales (covers, chargers) also tick upward. 
o Portable audio (earbuds, selfie sticks) often mirror each other, hinting at 
bundled promotions or joint marketing push. 
 
5. Business Implications 
• Inventory Planning: Allocate larger initial stocks for cameras and screen 
protectors, which have shown the strongest cumulative performance. 
• Promotional Strategy: Time bundle-deals mid-quarter to capitalize on natural 
demand surges—e.g., pairing phones with back covers or chargers. 
• Cross-sell Potential: Leverage strong smartphone days to push complementary 
accessories (earbuds, power banks).
